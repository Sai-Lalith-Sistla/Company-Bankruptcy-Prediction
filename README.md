### Understanding the business objective and the data

Bankruptcy or business failure can have a negative impact both on the enterprise itself and the global economy. Business practitioners, investors, governments, and academic researchers have long studied ways to identify the potential risk of business failure in order to reduce the economic loss caused by bankruptcy (Balleisen, 2001, Zywicki, 2008).

In short, bankruptcy prediction is a very important task for many related financial institutions. In general, the aim is to predict the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt. Financial institutions are in need of effective prediction models in order to make appropriate lending decisions.
